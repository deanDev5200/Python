As the wind whips 'round
I take a breath for victory
Wanna play tag, or wave your white flag?
'Cause you'll never touch me
King of hearts, all in (all in)
It's not a sin to wanna win (sin to wanna win)
Can't see me flying like a bee, black and yellow energy
Only me on my team, naturally
I see a dreamer
Over there by the water
But I got no, but I got no
Kakorrhaphiophobia
I see a dreamer
And he's ripe for the slaughter
But I got no, but I got no
Kakorrhaphiophobia
Phobia, phobia, phobia, ow
I hear battalions sing of my demise
But I don't know the words (what?)
I take a road of my own making
On a journey, no returning
Whoa, whoa
That's how it goes
They've drawn the battle line
And I see fire in their eyes
Na na na na na na
I'm better off not listening, huh
Na na na na na na
I've got my own song to sing
We're flying like a bee, black and yellow energy
Only me on my team, naturally yeah
I see a dreamer
Over there by the water
But I got no, but I got no
Kakorrhaphiophobia
I see a dreamer
And he's ripe for the slaughter
But I got no, but I got no
Kakorrhaphiophobia
Phobia, phobia, phobia (phobia)
Ooh
My boat is full, why don't you swim?
Enjoy my fortress, I'll be right in
I stare a hole through danger's soul
We all know
I can do this, eyes closed
I refuse to fail
So heed this cautionary tale
You've got dragons, my little friend
You'll conquer them in the end
If you can, haha
I see a dreamer
Over there by the water
Oh, but I got no, but I got no
Kakorrhaphiophobia
I see a dreamer
And he's ripe for the slaughter
Oh, but I got no, but I got no
Kakorrhaphiophobia
Phobia, phobia, phobia
Huh, huh
Phobia, phobia, phobia
